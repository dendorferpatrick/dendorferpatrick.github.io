<p>I am a Deep Learning PhD student at the Technical University of Munich. I am part of the Dynamic vision and Learning Group <a href="https://dvl.in.tum.de/">DVL</a> and supervised by Professor Laura Leal-Taixé.</p>

<p>My research topic is pedestrian trajectory prediction and multi-object tracking. I want to use deep generative models to study the dynamic behaviour and prediction of human motion.</p> 

<p>Before starting a Ph.D. in Computer Vision, I studied physics at the Ludwig-Maximilians Universität, Universidade de Lisboa, and University of Oxford.</p>

<p>I am from Munich and I really like the ne to the Bavarian mountains. In my free time I enjoy running, playing guitar, and meeting up with friends for a drink or two.</p>
