<p class="text">In the recent past, the computer vision community has relied on several centralized benchmarks for 
performance evaluation of numerous tasks including object detection, pedestrian detection, 3D reconstruction, optical 
flow, single-object short-term tracking, and stereo estimation.</p>

<p class="text">In our project we work on <a href="https://motchallenge.net/">motchallenge.net</a>,  an online platform for evalauting methods on a number of well established datasets and challenges.
Our website provides a fair and transparent evaluation protocol. The results are shown on a public leaderboard on the website. 
At this moment, we have +2k active users who already submit +5k methods on challenges reaching from detection, multi-object tracking over tracking and segmentation.</p>
<p class="text">Check out MOTChallenge <a href="motchallenge.net">(here)</a> to download one of the datasets, submit your results or provide data for a new challenge.</p> 
<p class="text">The performance of these numerous allows us also to analyze the current trends in tracking methods and gives us an overview of the evolution of 
the performance of mulit-object trackers. For further read have a look at our IJCV journal paper <a href="">"<em>MOTChallenge: A Benchmark for Single-camera Multiple Target Tracking</em>"</a>.</p>
